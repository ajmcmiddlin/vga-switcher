Simple C program that sends the ON/OFF commands to the switch file in
/sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch.  We are writing a C program because
a shell script is not safe to be run with setuid as root.

Takes either ON or OFF as its only argument.  ON turns the discrete graphics
on, and OFF turns it off.

NOTE: This code has only been tested on Xubuntu 11.10 with the latest
version of asus-switcheroo from awilliam's github repo.

This code is open source, but I have no idea what license to use.
